# Services Directory

This directory will contain API service functions that will be added incrementally as we rebuild the system.

## Planned Services

### Authentication
- `authService` - Login, logout, password reset
- `userService` - User profile management

### Data Management
- `buildingService` - Building CRUD operations
- `tenantService` - Tenant management
- `maintenanceService` - Maintenance requests
- `paymentService` - Payment processing

### Community Features
- `communityService` - Groups and posts
- `businessService` - Business directory
- `reviewService` - Reviews and ratings

## Development Approach

1. Start with simple CRUD operations
2. Add error handling and validation
3. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces (when added)
4. Keep services focused and single-purpose
5. Use consistent error handling patterns
6. Implement proper caching strategies
