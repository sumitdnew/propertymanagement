# Hooks Directory

This directory will contain custom React hooks that will be added incrementally as we rebuild the system.

## Planned Hooks

### Data Management
- `useDataFetch` - Generic data fetching hook
- `useDashboardData` - Dashboard-specific data aggregation
- `useUserProfile` - User profile management
- `useBuildings` - Building data management

### Authentication
- `useAuth` - Authentication state management
- `usePermissions` - User permission checking

### UI State
- `useModal` - Modal state management
- `useForm` - Form state management
- `usePagination` - Pagination logic

## Development Approach

1. Start with simple, focused hooks
2. Test hooks thoroughly before using in components
3. Keep hooks single-purpose and reusable
4. Use TypeScript for better type safety (when added)
5. Follow React hooks best practices
