# Contexts Directory

This directory will contain React Context providers that will be added incrementally as we rebuild the system.

## Planned Contexts

### Authentication
- `AuthContext` - User authentication state
- `UserContext` - User profile and permissions

### Application State
- `AppContext` - Global application state
- `ThemeContext` - UI theme and preferences
- `LanguageContext` - Internationalization

### Data Management
- `DataContext` - Global data state
- `CacheContext` - Data caching and optimization

## Development Approach

1. Start with minimal context usage
2. Add contexts only when needed
3. Keep context providers focused and lightweight
4. Avoid prop drilling without over-engineering
5. Use context sparingly - prefer local state when possible
